Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following:

    - Search previous suggestions before making a new one to prevent duplication.
    - Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
    - Use the following format: :emoji: [NAME](LINK): DESCRIPTION.
    - Keep descriptions simple.
    - New categories, or improvements to the existing ones are welcome.
    - End all descriptions with a period.
    - Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
    - Try to ensure your pull requests only have one commit if possible. You can squash your commits into one before submitting.
    - Make your pull request titles and descriptions as detailed as possible. Explain why an asset or resources deserves to be added to the list.
    - My goal is to organize headings in the order they might become relevant in development.
    - Please ensure your submissions are high quality, documented and are being actively maintained. 
    - Free/Open-source/Open-license resources should be prioritized.

Thanks!
