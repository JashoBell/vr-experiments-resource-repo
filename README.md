# VR Research Resource Repository

This repository is intended to be a curated repository of resources that are relevant to developing XR-based studies for experimental psychology or similar fields of research. Where possible, it is focused on free and open-source resources. If relevant, the resources should be actively maintained/updated, because this space moves relatively quickly and the changes tend to be substantive. It is not intended to be a list of all VR-related resources, but high-quality general resources that might be useful to VR experiments will be included. The goal is to provide a centralized location for all of the tools available to VR researchers, so the time normally spent searching for them can instead be spent developing, and development decisions can be made with all the relevant info available. 

If you have any suggestions for additions, please feel free to open a discussion thread, issue or pull request (after checking CONTRIBUTING.md), or just reach out to the maintainer (@jashobell) via another platform. If you are building an experiment and would like to either ask for assistance or share your experiences, triumphs and frustrations, feel free to open a discussion.

**Planned Additions**:

- Hardware platforms/Tracking systems
- More content (esp. Unreal Engine)
- A wiki
    - Tutorials/Informational content
    - References
        - Guidelines/Best Practices (e.g. [Vasser & Aru, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X20300683))
        - Exemplars

## Feature Development  
Third-party libraries and tools that can be used to implement features in your VR experiment.

### General

- :green_circle: :orange_square: [Mixed Reality Toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit) - "MRTK is a Microsoft-driven project that provides a set of components and features, used to accelerate cross-platform MR app development in Unity or Unreal".

### Inverse Kinematics (IK) Solvers
These resources enable the implementation of self-avatars for participants.

- :green_circle: [FinalIK](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/final-ik-14290) - A paid asset (often on sale) for Unity that includes a variety of IK solvers. VRIK in particular is useful in this context, and implements full-body IK.
- :green_circle: :orange_square: [Manus Polygon](https://www.manus-meta.com/software/polygon) - Free full-body motion capture software that can stream data into Unity or Unreal. Does not facilitate partial IK (i.e., you need enough trackers attached for full-body tracking).
- :green_circle: [VRArmIK (Parger et al., 2018)](https://github.com/dabeschte/VRArmIK) - IK solver focused on recreating arm movements from the head and hand. Useful for implementing a self-avatar with only a head-mounted tracker and a hand tracker ([Abstract](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3281505.3281529)).

### Movement Smoothing
These resources can be used to smooth positional data in real-time. Useful if representing virtual objects with potentially noisy motion capture data (e.g., Infrared LED) that don't otherwise implement smoothing.

- :green_circle: [OneEuro Filter (Unity Implementation)](https://github.com/DarioMazzanti/OneEuroFilterUnity) - A port of the [OneEuro](https://gery.casiez.net/1euro/) filter to Unity.
